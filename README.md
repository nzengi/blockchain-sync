## Blockchain Sync - Parallel Block Downloader

Blockchain Sync is an advanced and efficient Rust-based blockchain synchronization project. This project leverages parallel block downloading techniques and asynchronous Rust programming using the tokio framework to provide fast, reliable synchronization across blockchain networks.

## Features:

Parallel Block Downloading: Utilizes parallelism to download multiple blocks at once, increasing performance and reducing synchronization time.
Error Handling & Retry Mechanism: Implements a robust retry mechanism for failed block downloads, ensuring reliability even in unstable network conditions.
Modular Architecture: Clean, modular, and scalable design to easily extend functionalities and support for additional blockchains.
Asynchronous Programming: Built with tokio, a modern asynchronous runtime for Rust, ensuring optimal performance and non-blocking I/O operations.
P2P Integration: Supports peer-to-peer communication for decentralized blockchain syncing using libp2p.
Custom Logging: Detailed logging for error handling, synchronization progress, and debugging.

## Technologies:

Rust: Systems programming language known for performance, reliability, and safety.
Tokio: Asynchronous runtime for Rust, enabling fast and efficient I/O operations.
Libp2p: Peer-to-peer networking library for building decentralized applications.
